# EmployeeManager

## Overview
This project was challenging to manage the volume of code that had to be written im sure I could of made it more concise with the amount of repetition that was involved

## successes
I was able to add departments and employees, and view both of them in a table

## failure
I was not able to add anything to the role table, and I was not able to get the update employee function to work
